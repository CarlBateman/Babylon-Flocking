access "class"/"instance" variables from callback


notes
-----
find params for specific behaviour
	- birds
	- fish
	- etc

trails - not flock/boid responsibility
colours based on direction
colours based on position
show limits???

update alternate updates
prevent collisions

Debugging
	show decisions (heading, neighbours, etc.)




• Bodies that meet should form a flock.
• The flock member should not collide with each other.
• The flock should not spontaneously lose members.
• The flock should not spontaneously split off into new flocks.
